# Polynomial Calculator  

This project implements a polynomial calculator in Java, capable of performing various algebraic operations on polynomials. Users can input polynomial expressions, and the program processes them to compute:  

- **Multiplication** (polynomial × polynomial)  
- **Exponentiation** (polynomial raised to a power)  
- **Differentiation** (first derivative of a polynomial)  
- **Integration** (indefinite integral of a polynomial)  

The calculator parses input expressions, applies the requested operations, and returns simplified results.  

## Features  

✔ **Input Flexibility**: Accepts polynomials in standard algebraic form (e.g., `3x^2 + 2x - 5`).  
✔ **Mathematical Operations**: Supports multiplication, exponentiation, derivatives, and integrals.  
✔ **Object-Oriented Design**: Built with Java, leveraging classes for polynomials, operations, and parsing.  
✔ **Error Handling**: Validates input syntax and handles edge cases (e.g., invalid exponents).
